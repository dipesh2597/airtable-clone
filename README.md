## Architecture Overview

### System Design

The application follows a client-server architecture with real-time communication:

```
┌─────────────────┐    WebSocket     ┌─────────────────┐
│   React Client  │ ◄──────────────► │  FastAPI Server │
│   (Frontend)    │                  │   (Backend)     │
└─────────────────┘                  └─────────────────┘
         │                                     │
         │                                     │
    ┌─────────┐                          ┌─────────┐
    │Browser  │                          │Excel    │
    │Storage  │                          │Files    │
    └─────────┘                          └─────────┘
```

### Real-time Implementation

**WebSocket Communication:**
- Uses Socket.IO for bidirectional real-time communication
- Server maintains in-memory state for spreadsheet data and user presence
- Clients connect via Socket.IO-client for live updates

**State Management:**
- **Backend**: In-memory dictionaries for spreadsheet data and active users
- **Frontend**: React state with useEffect hooks for real-time synchronization
- **Data Flow**: Changes propagate from client → server → all connected clients

**Key Components:**
- `main.py`: FastAPI server with Socket.IO integration
- `App.js`: Main React component managing WebSocket connections
- `Spreadsheet.js`: Core spreadsheet component with real-time updates
- `DataPersistence.js`: Handles save/load operations

## 👥 Collaboration Features

### Multi-User Editing

**User Management:**
- Unique user identification with session-based tracking
- Color-coded user presence indicators
- Real-time user list with connection status

**Live Collaboration:**
- **Cell Updates**: Changes appear instantly across all connected users
- **Cursor Tracking**: See other users' current cell selections in real-time
- **User Presence**: Visual indicators show who's currently editing
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins strategy for concurrent edits

**Real-time Events:**
- `cell_update`: Broadcasts cell changes to all users
- `cell_selection`: Shows other users' cursor positions
- `user_joined/user_left`: Updates user presence
- `spreadsheet_loaded`: Synchronizes data when files are loaded

### How It Works

1. **Connection**: Users connect via WebSocket and join the spreadsheet session
2. **Editing**: When a user edits a cell, the change is sent to the server
3. **Broadcast**: Server validates the change and broadcasts to all connected users
4. **Sync**: All clients receive the update and update their local state
5. **Visual Feedback**: Users see real-time cursors and presence indicators

## Feature Overview

### Core Spreadsheet Features

**Grid Interface:**
- 26 columns (A-Z) and 100 rows
- Clickable and editable cells with visual selection
- Column headers and row numbers
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Tab, Enter)

**Data Types & Validation:**
- **Text**: Standard text input with length validation
- **Numbers**: Integer, decimal, and scientific notation support
- **Dates**: Multiple format support (MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)
- **Formulas**: Basic formula support (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on data type and format

**Advanced Features:**

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Real-time Sync Strategy

**WebSocket Choice:**
- **Socket.IO**: Chosen for its reliability, automatic reconnection, and cross-browser compatibility
- **Alternative Considered**: Raw WebSockets were considered but Socket.IO provides better error handling and fallback mechanisms

**State Synchronization:**
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately for better perceived performance
- **Server Validation**: All changes validated server-side before broadcasting
- **Conflict Resolution**: Simple last-write-wins strategy for concurrent edits

**Data Flow:**
```
User Input → Client Validation → Server → Server Validation → Broadcast → All Clients
```

### Conflict Resolution

**Current Implementation:**
- **Last-Write-Wins**: Most recent change takes precedence
- **Timestamp-based**: Server timestamps all modifications
- **Cell-level**: Conflicts resolved at individual cell level

**Trade-offs:**
- **Pros**: Simple, predictable, low latency
- **Cons**: May lose some user changes in high-concurrency scenarios

**Future Considerations:**
- Operational transformation for more sophisticated conflict resolution
- Version vectors for better change tracking
- Undo/redo functionality with change history

### Data Validation Strategy

**Multi-layer Validation:**
- **Client-side**: Immediate feedback for better UX
- **Server-side**: Ensures data integrity and consistency
- **Type Detection**: Automatic detection of data types (text, number, date, formula)

**Validation Features:**
- Real-time type detection and formatting
- Formula syntax validation
- Date format validation with multiple format support
- Number format validation including scientific notation

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Current Constraints

**Scalability:**
- In-memory storage limits concurrent users
- No database persistence (Excel file only)
- Single-server architecture

**Real-time Features:**
- Basic conflict resolution (last-write-wins)
- No operational transformation
- Limited undo/redo functionality

**Data Types:**
- Limited formula support (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT only)
- No complex data types (images, links, etc.)
- Basic date format support
- **Formula Input Limitations**: 
  - Cannot select ranges using mouse - ranges must be entered manually
  - Formula autocomplete shows supported functions but clicking on them causes errors
  - Range selection via mouse is not supported and will cause errors

**Performance:**
- No pagination for large datasets
- All data loaded in memory
- No caching strategy

### Technical Debt

**Code Organization:**
- Some components could be further modularized
- Error handling could be more comprehensive
- Testing coverage is limited

**Security:**
- No authentication or authorization
- CORS configured for development only
- No input sanitization beyond basic validation
